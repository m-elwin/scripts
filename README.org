2. Create the fake camera device 
   - =sudo modprobe v4l2loopback exclusive_caps=1 card_label=FakeWebcam=
   - To load the module on boot create =/etc/modules-load.d/v4l2loopback.conf=
     =v4l2loopback=
   - Options are placed in =/etc/modprobe.d/v4l2loopback.conf=
     =options v4l2loopback exclusive_caps=1 card_label=FakeCamera=
3. =v4l2-ctl --list-devices= shows you which =/dev/videoX= is the fake camera and which are real cameras
4. Run =video_loop input_video output_device=
5. Run =ffplay output_device= to verify that it is working
6. Run =video_record output_file input_device= to record a video from the webcamera.
